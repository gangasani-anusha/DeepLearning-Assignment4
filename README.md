# DeepLearning-Assignment4

This assignment is implemented using:

- Hyperparameters learning rate decay, dropout, batch norm
- Weights and Biases of Hyperparameters in weights and biases of various optimizers, layer depth width, learning rate etc.,. both in keras and pytorch
- Keras Classifier for regression problem, image problem 
- Illustrating the use of various activation functions, dropouts, learning rate schedulers , regularization techniques like gradient clipping, batch normalization, early stopping, l1 and l2 regularizations, optimizers on simple data set
